Description: Functions for basic hydraulic calculations related to 
    water flow in circular pipes flowing full (under pressure). This
    includes friction loss calculations by solving the Darcy-Weisbach
    equation for head loss, flow or diameter, and plotting a Moody diagram. 
    The Darcy-Weisbach friction factor is calculated using the Colebrook (or 
    Colebrook-White equation), the basis of the Moody diagram, the original 
    citation being Colebrook (1939) <doi:10.1680/ijoti.1939.13150>. The 
    derivation of the Darcy-Weisbach equation and methods for its solution 
    are outlined in many fluid mechanics texts such as Finnemore and Franzini 
    (2002, ISBN:978-0072432022). This package is designed to work similarly
    to the 'iemisc' package, but with an emphasis on pipe flow.
