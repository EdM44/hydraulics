Description: Functions for basic hydraulic calculations related to 
    water flow in circular pipes both flowing full (under pressure), and 
    partially full (gravity flow), and trapezoidal open channels. For 
    pressure flow this includes friction loss calculations by solving 
    the Darcy-Weisbach equation for head loss, flow or diameter, and 
    plotting a Moody diagram. The Darcy-Weisbach friction factor is 
    calculated using the Colebrook (or Colebrook-White equation), 
    the basis of the Moody diagram, the original citation being 
    Colebrook (1939) <doi:10.1680/ijoti.1939.13150>. For gravity flow, the
    Manning equation is used, again solving for missing parameters. The 
    derivation of and solutions using the Darcy-Weisbach equation and the
    Manning equation are outlined in many fluid mechanics texts such as 
    Finnemore and Franzini (2002, ISBN:978-0072432022). For the Manning equation
    solutions, this package uses modifications of original code from the 'iemisc' 
    package by Irucka Embry.
